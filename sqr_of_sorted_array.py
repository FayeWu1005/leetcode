# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
# Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
# Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
# Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
# After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
